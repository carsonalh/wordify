\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{wordify}

\begin{document}

Wordify is a latex package that makes a latex document look like a MS word 2019 document.

\section{Usage}

Wordify does all of its magic simply by adding \texttt{{\textbackslash}usepackage\{wordify\}} to the preamble of a document. The only other necessary configuration is to specify where the fonts are stored. On windows, this should be simple; the directory is \texttt{C:{\textbackslash}Windows{\textbackslash}Fonts}, but on OSX and Linux it may be necessary to download Calibri (main document font) and Cambria (mathematics font).

It should be noted that due to the usage of custom fonts, \texttt{xelatex} must be used to compile and not \texttt{pdflatex}.
